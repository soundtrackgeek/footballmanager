Let's create a football manager game in python. I want to emulate the FA Premier League so I need 20 teams. Each team needs a squad of 20 players each, 11 which can be picked for any game. The game will be for 1-4 players and each player gets to pick his team from the 20 available.

+ Let's simulate the games itself. In 1 season of football each team plays each other twice, one home and one away. So when the game starts, the fixture list of the season is created randomly, maybe saved to a file instead of using memory so the game uses the file to know which fixture is played and when it is played. We probably need to add weeks as well. 38 weeks in total.

+ Feel free to make more python files or split the ones you have if that makes more sense. We need an opening menu. We can have 1. Team, 2. Tactics, 3. Fixtures, 4. Transfer Market, 5 Play Game. When player choose 1, list the current team. When player choose 3, show the fixture list for the current week. 2, 4 and 5 don't do anything yet, just keep the menu options.

+ Let's create a football table. It will list Team, Played, Won, Drawn, Lost, GF, GA, GD, Points. Team is the team. Played is how many games the team has played. Won is how many games the team has won. Drawn is how many games the team has drawn. Lost is how many games the team has lost. GF stands for Goals For and shows how many goals the team has scored in total. GA stands for Goals Against and shows how many goals the team has conceded in total. GD stands for Goal Difference and shows the Goals For minus Goals Against. Points is how many points a team has. There's 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 point for a loss. We also need a menu option for Table that shows the current table.

+ As you can see after I pressed 5 to simulate games, it simulated some games, but look at the table. It doesn't make sense. We've only in week 1 and played 1 game, yet Luton has played 4 and Tottenham 3 and some teams like Bournemouth and Burnley hasn't played any. Each team needs to play only 1 game in week 1 and the table need to reflect that.

+ I want you to create simulation of all 38 weeks next like we discussed earlier. So each week, the teams will play each other based on the created fixture list. Right now keep it simple.

+ Let's create a folder called Teams. And in that folder, let's create a file for each of the 20 teams. In those files, I want to create 20 random players when a new game starts for each team. This is so we can make a deeper simulation with players, ratings and transfer market later.

+ Now that we have pupulated all teams with players that have ratings, let's create a submenu under 1. Team. We can have 1. View Team, 2. Select Team. The View Team option just shows the players like before, but the Select team allows the player to select 11 players that will be playing the next match. And based on the team the player is selecting, calculate the total rating. That will be used later to simulate the games, so if a team has higher rating than the opponent, there's a higher chance to win the game and vice versa.

+ All the teams now has generated players. Create an algorithm so that each team choose their best 11 players based on ratings each week, and those players will play the current weeks match.

+ Now that we have every team selected their starting 11, let's use them in matches. First let's start with goals. I notice that now when the matches are played, the entire selected team is listed and the average rating is shown. Instead of having the team listed and average rating, let's hide that. Instead, let's show who scored the goals for each team FW has a higher chance of scoring the goals, but everyone can score. Also players, specially FW with higher ratings has a higher chance of scoring goals as well. Let's also add what minute they scored the goal in. A game lasts for 90 minutes.

+ Let's make another menu option called 8. Stats. In there we get a submenu. 1. Player Stats. 2. Club Stats. Under Player Stats, let's have lists displayed for the following: Goals (This one show the top 10 goalscorers). We'll add more stats later. Under Club Stats let's have top 10 lists for the following: Wins (Shows number of wins in a row), Losses (Shows number of losses in a row). We'll add more later.

+ Let's add some more stats to players. I think we need Age and Value. Age can be between 16 and 35. Value can be between 0 and 100 million pounds. Value is calculated based on the rating of the player, the age and position. FW are worth most, then MF, then DF, then GK. The younger a player are the more value he has, but overall rating is most important.

+ Let's add another menu option called "Finances". We'll have a submenu under here. 1. View Finances. 2. Sponsorships. 3. Bank Loan. View Finances just shows us an overall view of how much money we have. The others for now can just be placeholders when we add those later.

+ Let's work on that Bank Loan option. In here we'll be able to loan money from the bank. First you type in how much you want to loan. Then we can choose between 3 different banks. Come up with 10 random bank names and randomly choose 3 of them to choose from. When you choose a bank, you can see the terms. You can see how long the loan goes for, and how much interest, and also a calculation to see how much I have to pay each week.

+ Let's work on sponsorships. When you go into that menu you are presented with 3 different sponsorships (You can come up with 20 random business names from which you display 3). So we can choose one of the sponsorship deals. When we do, we get the details on how much money they will give us each week and for how many weeks.

+ Let's keep a list of stadiums and their maximum attendance for each club. Use the proper statium names and proper attendance numbers. For each home game, the fans fill the stadiums. Sometimes it's almost full and sometimes, there's less. This will be used for financial reasons later.

Lets add some financial things to happen every week. So after every gameweek, we can have a summary screen of things happening. For example if we have home games, the fans fill the stadiums, sometimes almost full and sometimes there's less, but each fan buys a ticket to get in, so use realistic ticket prices, and calculate how much money each club makes in a gameweek and add it to the finances.

I want to add an exciting match screen whenever I click 5. Play Game. This screen is only for my game in the fixture list this week, the team I've chosen. I want each minute to tick, maybe 1 second per minute, then randomly someone scores. Come up with some great commentator lines when someone scores.
